Ideas
===

 * Space trading game (ascii graphics maybe?)
   * Charged to save your species/planet
   * Sent off with the last of your planets resources
   * Have to trade resources to get enough of certain things to save your planet


The Last Star Trader
===

 * Planets and races have predefined names, but random stats and motivations
 * Each planet has it's own stats for resources it prefers or doesn't want

TODO
===

 * Start working on resources to be traded
 * Flesh out planets with resource related data
 * Build initial system for handling trading with numbers only
 * Add text interface support
 * Start working on scenes and how they will work
